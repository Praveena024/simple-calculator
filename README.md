# Simple Calculator in Java

This Java program implements a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user is prompted to input two numbers and select an operator. The program then computes and displays the result based on the chosen operator.

## Features

- Supports the following arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  
- Takes user input for two numbers and the operation to perform.
- Handles basic error handling for invalid operator input.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or later

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-calculator-java.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder.

   ```bash
   cd simple-calculator-java
   ```

3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.

   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the operator and the two numbers.

## Example

```
Choose an operator: +,-,*,/ : 
+
Enter first number :
10
Enter second number :
20
10.0 + 20.0 = 30.0
```

## Error Handling

If the user enters an invalid operator, the program will display an error message:

```
Invalid operator!
```
